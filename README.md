# Tree-drawing-algorithm-richard-dawkins-biomorph#
My attempt at recreating Richard Dawkins' "biomorphs" program, as described in "The Blind Watchmaker".
So far incomplete, Dawkins says his uses 9 genes but mine so far only has 5.
Details on how the actual tree is drawn are scarce in the book - but this seems close enough.
no ability to "Breed" trees yet
